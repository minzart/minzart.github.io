\begin_layout Section*
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any noun (person, place, thing, or idea) can be categorized as an 
\emph on
object
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the physical world, it is rare to find two objects that are exactly the
 same; instead, we think of objects as functionally equivalent in some quantitat
ive way.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
e.g.
 It does not matter if we count with our fingers starting from the thumb
 or the pinky; we get to the same number.
 In this case, each of our fingers are the same as the others, and we are
 using each of them to represent 1.
 In this case, all of our fingers (physical entities) and the number 1 (a
 mathematical concept) are essentially equivalent to one another!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Mathematicians use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to show that two objects are functionally equivalent, or e
\emph on
qual
\emph default
.
 These objects are on both sides of an 
\emph on
equation
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When two objects are equal, they are still equal after performing the same
 
\emph on
operation
\emph default
 (what mathematicians call structured procedures) to both of them.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
e.g.
 If I have two identical apples then slice, dice, and mash them in the same
 way, I should theoretically get two identical servings of applesauce.
 I am performing the same operation (the preparations for the apples) on
 two equivalent objects (the identical apples), so I should get the same
 object back out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
e.g.
 If Alice and Bob have the same number of toys and I give them each one
 more, they still have the same number of toys.
 In this case, the objects are the numbers describing the amount of physical
 objects (toys), and the operation is me giving each of them another toy.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Note: even though Alice and Bob's piles of toys have the same number of
 toys inside (ergo, the amount of toys are equal), I do not know if the
 toys themselves are equivalent (marbles vs.
 puzzles), so I cannot say that the two piles of toys are equal.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
e.g.
 In the finger example, the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantity of fingers held up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is equal to some number; if we hold up one more finger, we should also
 add 1 to our number.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Algebra
\emph default
 seeks to describe how operations affect mathematical objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most common operations used in algebra are addition (+) and multiplication
 (×).
 (Note that subtraction and division are simply forms of addition and multiplica
tion!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Often, to solve problems, we use 
\emph on
variables
\emph default
 to take the place of mathematical objects; this is helpful when the mathematica
l object being replaced refers to another unknown value.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
e.g.
 Can you immediately think of the number that is 6 smaller than its triple?
 No worries if you can't! Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 be this number; since we are told that this number is equal to its triple
 minus 6:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}x=\mbox{ } & 3x-6 &  &  & [\mbox{Set the two equal.]}\\
(x)-x=\mbox{ } & (3x-6)-x &  &  & \mbox{ [*Subtract \ensuremath{x\mbox{ from both sides.}}]}\\
0=\mbox{ } & 2x-6 &  &  & \mbox{[Simplify into equivalent expression.]}\\
(0)+6=\mbox{ } & (2x-6)+6 &  &  & \mbox{[Add 6 to both sides.]}\\
6=\mbox{ } & 2x &  &  & \mbox{[Simplify into equivalent expression.]}\\
6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\mbox{ } & 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &  &  & \mbox{[Divide 2 from both sides.]}\\
3=\mbox{ } & x &  &  & \mbox{[Simplify into equivalent expression.]}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
* Yes, we can subtract variables if they describe the same thing! I can
 say that one finger plus two fingers is three fingers, or that taking away
 three apples from four leaves me with one apple.
 In the same way, we had three 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

's, and then we simply took away one of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From this, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $x=3$
\end_inset

,
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\strikeout off
\uuline off
\uwave off
\noun off
\color none
 and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\ensuremath{x}$
\end_inset

 was describing the number that we wanted to find, we now know that 3 is
 6 smaller than its triple!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We converted a word problem into an equation (and replacing values we do
 not know with variables), then conducted identical operations to both sides
 until we finally get the equality expression we need (in this case, something
 in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $x=$
\end_inset

? ).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A hint for some of the word problems: equations can be thought of as objects
 too! In fact, this is a huge part of computer science.
 (The following example might be strange, but bear with me.)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Let's say we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b=c+d$
\end_inset

, and we also know that 
\begin_inset Formula $a=d.$
\end_inset

 Notice that since 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 are equal, subtracting 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the same as subtracting 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Subtract 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 from the left and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 from the right to get that 
\begin_inset Formula $b=c$
\end_inset

! Another way to see this is that you are stacking the two equations, then
 just carrying out a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long subtraction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem:
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a+b & = & c+d\\
a & = & d\\
---- & - & ----\\
(a+b)-a & = & (c+d)-d\\
b & = & c
\end{eqnarray*}

 (There are actually two answers to this; try to find both! Note that I
 could have also written this as 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{2}=16$
\end_inset

.
 The superscript 2, the 
\emph on
exponent
\emph default
, means you multiply two of the 
\emph on
base
\emph default
 together.
 If I had 
\begin_inset Formula $3^{5},$

 that's the same as 3×3×3×3×3.)

 (Careful! There are two answers.
 HINT: You cannot just divide out a value unless you know either it cannot
 be 0, or until you already took the answer 0 into account.
 This is because in mathematics, dividing by 0 is not defined!)

\begin_inset Formula $b$

 can just be treated as a value! We call this

The sum of two numbers is 84, and one of them is 12 more than the other.
 What are the two numbers? (Tip: if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 is the smaller number, what would the bigger one be? What should the two
 add up to?)

Two small pitchers and one large pitcher can hold 8 cups of water.
 One large pitcher holds 2 cups of water more than a small pitcher.
 How many cups of water can each pitcher hold? (Try 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

replacing
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 all of one type of pitcher with an equivalent amount of the other plus
 some amount of cups of water.
 Note that one large pitcher holds as much as a small pitcher plus two cups
 of water.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A test worth 100 points has twenty questions.
 The test consists of True/False questions worth 3 points each and multiple
 choice questions worth 11 points each.
 How many multiple choice questions are on the test? (You have enough informatio
n to make two equations! Play around with them until you can solve for the
 number of one type of test question, then use that to find the number of
 the other type.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A mental math trick I learned from one of my math team coaches: if you want
 to multiply a two-digit number that ends with 5 by itself (so we would
 find 
\begin_inset Formula $25^{2}$
\end_inset

 if the number is 25), take the first digit, multiply it by itself plus
 1, then stick 25 to the end of it (25 starts with 2, 2 times 3 is 6, then
 sticking 25 on the end we get 625 which is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $25^{2}).$
\end_inset

 Figure out which number I started with if I ended up with 3025.
 (This question is easy, but it illustrates how you can get answers by trying
 to work backwards.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(Bonus Question) Here is another mental math trick: if a number is in the
 fifties (50 to 59), you can find is square (that is, the result of multiplying
 it by itself) with the following method: first, add the units digit to
 25.
 Then, take the value we get, and stick the two-digit form of the square
 of the units digit onto the end of that value.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So as an example, 52 has 2 in its units digit; add that to 25 to get 27,
 then stick 04 (which is the two-digit form of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{2}=4)$
\end_inset

 on the end to get that 
\begin_inset Formula $52^{2}=2704$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also works in a similar way for numbers slightly below 50 or above
 59.
 With this information, what is the square root (the number whose square
 is equal to the given number) of 2116? Of 3721? Tip: when we use this squaring
 trick on a value from 50 to 59, the first step can be seen as a shortcut
 for finding the distance from that value from 50 and adding it to 25, while
 the second step is a shortcut for multiplying the value from step by 100
 then adding the square of the distance from 50 we already found.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
These questions will test your understanding.
 Take some time to think!
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $(x-2)(3)=(x-2)(4)$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $x-2=0$
\end_inset

 (both sides equal 0).
 Now, divide both sides by 
\begin_inset Formula $x-2$
\end_inset

.
 We’re left with 
\begin_inset Formula $3=4$
\end_inset

, which is mathematical nonsense! What went wrong? (What are we really dividing
 by?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Imagine that there are many bags containing five apples.
 If I take two bags of apples one day and three bags the next, how many
 apples should I have in total? Is this different from me buying five bags
 of apples at once? With this logic in mind, try to explain what 
\begin_inset Formula $(a+b)\text{ × \ensuremath{c}}$
\end_inset

 would be equal to.
 What about 
\begin_inset Formula $(a+b)(c+d)$
