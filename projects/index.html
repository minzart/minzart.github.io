	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>Here is a (perhaps needlessly long) summary of the stuff I am currently working on. This is also pretty much my to-do list, which is nice for me.</p>
	<h3>Fifth Love (Visual Novel) <br>November 2016 - present</h3>
	<p>As someone who was deeply impacted by Katawa Shoujo, I decided to use my writing and music knowledge to create a visual novel.</p> 
	<p>Currently, the plot is being finalized. The basic idea is four routes with four different girls in the main character's life who help him realize (in the fifth "true" route) that he never loved himself.</p>
	<p>I am working on many writing and music pieces based around my VN right now. I will upload assets to those respective pages.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Personal Webpage - minzart.github.io <br>January 2016 - present</h3> 
	<p>I learned HTML as a child, when I played Neopets and wanted to customize my own page just like all the "cool kids" did. But after I was done with Neopets, I ended up using these HTML skills I learned in middle school to make one of those Jottit websites. I remember having fun making a "page chain" with my friends, and the little dramas we had where we "borrowed" each other's code and made little JavaScript popup loops that made it look like the user's computer got infected with a virus. (Evil, I know. My music teacher fell for it, and he was positively panicked.)</p>
	<p>In high school, I met a few people who were super good at design, and until recently it discouraged me from trying it myself. But I spent the entire day on January 13th just trying to put the basic HTML/CSS I know into making something I can be proud of. The best part is, those amazing friends are giving me their insights on both the aesthetics and the technical aspects of creating this webpage.</p>
	<p>My current goals for this are to make some JavaScript effects, like a banner that appears on the top when the header is out of sight. Also, it would be nice if once the navigation bar is out of sight, all the divs center on the page.</p>
	<h3>Code to Gallantry: RPG <br>December 2015 - present</h3> 
	<p><i>This is currently on hiatus while I focus on music. I am interested in continuing it, though.</i></p>
	<p>Some background: This school year is basiclaly the first where I seriously put myself to learning to code properly. My first actual programming language was JavaScript, but I only used it in enfantine HTML sites (which I already talked about in the section above). In high school, I wanted to learn programming so I joined the computer science club; however, I had neither the patience to learn the syntax properly nor the passion to make anything, so I ended up not attending the club for the rest of high school.</p>
	<p>It was over the summer before university started that I began to learn Python and do small mathematical tasks with it to make my life easier when solving random contest math problems. After entering university and taking a course on computing (where we used Python and NumPy), I realized I really enjoyed the mathematical problem solving that comes with programming. From there (and with the encouragement of a few super talented friends), I really put myself into learning about full-stack programming.</p>
	<p>This project basically a herald to the start of my commitment of making useful and non-trivial coding projects. Code to Gallantry's name is a play on the Louis Cha novel "Ode to Gallantry", and my current idea for the plot is heavily based around concepts from that book.</p>
	<p>I am writing the code in Python, which I learned through Codecademy a while back but never actually used to do anything useful. Currently, I am thinking of a way to convert all the code I have now (complete with way too many dictionaries...) into something cleaner. I have not used classes that much, but I will try to learn enough to make this code more efficient.</p>
	
	<h3>Waterloo ARML Math Team <br>2014 - 2016</h3> 
	<p>I started this team with a few friends in 2014, branching off from the (in)famous Vincent Massey Secondary School math team. Our first year, we got 4th place in Division B, beating out a bunch of state teams. Since I already graduated high school, I am helping out the team by helping with weekly practices and proctoring for any smaller contests.</p>
	<p>To help boost the sustainability of the team, I started a youth class branching out of the team to try to inspire some interest in contest math in our community. It didn't end up taking off, but I am leaving the sample handouts on this website in case someone wants to check out the handouts from the first two lectures.</p>
