\begin_layout Standard
All to be known about human relationships can be summed up by the motion
 of celestial bodies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two bodies in space attract each other and endlessly inch closer.
 It is the law of the universe.
 Two bodies, no matter how far or how different, pull longingly to shrink
 the gap that spans worlds, galaxies, eternities.
 And they only increase in their desire to be with the other as they traverse
 the vastness of space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closer and closer they draw, until finally they are there together, with
 but hundreds of thousands of miles between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strength of gravitational pull in inversely proportional to the square
 of the distance.
 A halved distance is a four-fold strong force, locking the new bodies on
 a course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A path to collision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it is two meek planets, who eventually glance each other ever so slightly.
 They pass by each other, each gaining a fresh dent on their surfaces.
 With but millions of years, all trace of memory erodes away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it is a planet and a brilliant star.
 The light is irresistible, and the star knows.
 The planet hurdles through emptiness towards the shining beacon, until
 the pull tears this little speck into a billion pieces.
 The fragments of the poor planet are consumed by the star without even
 a sign of hesitation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it is two stars, each mesmerized by the other.
 Their hellish flames lick the other as they finally consummate their desires,
 and a fiery display lights up the evening sky.
 Both are scattered in a cloud of dust, which forms into more celestial
 bodies destined on destructive courses through the universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what of the two stars that are locked in their eternal tango, dancing
 away timelessly and shining as if they were one? The endless sweeping around
 the other keeps the two at length, sparing the fate that other bodies must
 take.
 They are both contently burning, but still are forever longing to be pulled
 even closer, with their clueless wish to come together regardless of consequenc
e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in this universe seeks proximity, and all proximity is how all is destroyed
 and destroys.
 For in this pitiable reality the pursuit of proximity is the root of pain.
