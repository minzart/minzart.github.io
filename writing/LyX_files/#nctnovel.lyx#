Michelle in the present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes I sit and wonder if things might have turned out differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I get up from bed at the usual time, eat a usual breakfast of two sunny-side
 up eggs with bacon, and take my usual walking route through the vast countrysid
e to clear my mind.
 So many years now, it has been.
 But even after all this time, every time I look around and see the beautiful
 grassy hills, I feel ever closer to the world.
 As if I am yet another step closer to finding the meaning of life.
 Or finding God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shiver a little.
 My thin sweater keeps me rudely aware of the briskness of morning in early
 September.
 I can't say it feels like autumn at this time of year, but the mornings
 are a chilling reminder of what is to come.
 Leaves fall, followed by snow, followed by spirits.
 I hate winter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, thinking about God and the seasons has me in an inspired mood.
 I catch myself humming Debussy's 
\emph on
The Snow is Dancing

How long has it been since I heard that piece, yet I still remember how
 he plays it,

 I muse pensively to myself.
 Just like every morning, some train of thought brings me back to him.
 Just like every morning, I let tears fall down my face, with only the clouds
 and the warbling birds as witnesses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My therapist told me to stop writing for a while—that letting my mind run
 wild might prevent me from ever getting past this.
 But I am already at a point in life where there is no use to rid myself
 of these emotions, of those memories.
 After all, most of my sixty years revolved him.
 How curious it is that people want me to go 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

back to normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as if the first seventeen years of my life where I didn't know him are
 what normal really is for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it's time I give in.
 I am not being unusual or unlike myself, and for sure there is no point
 in trying to be who I was when I was seventeen.
 If anything, he is the one who let me become who I am today.
 A few tears shed every morning are a small price to pay for the gifts he
 gave me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's almost time for me to head back.
 I promised myself I would finish off that memoir today.
 My publishing agent will not be happy when she finds out I have been doing
 whatever it takes to find excuses to stop writing.
 It becomes a most difficult chore to not burn out and crash after so many
 years of not even having a chance to sit down and think.
 An author and playwright of significant reflective works doesn't have time
 to think; what irony this world beholds!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am nearing the edge of a small woodland.
 I will stop here for a bit, then I really have to get back.
 I follow the small trail through the light shrubbery and get to my special
 thinking spot.
 I sit down on the mighty rock, and look up.
 As always, the darker tones of the forest canopy bring out the brightness
 of the sky in this spot.
 There must have been some Creator out there who pities my inner turmoil
 enough to give me this place of sanctity and peace.
 The solidness of this huge boulder with a piece of the sky cut out from
 the tall thicket of trees convinces me that one day God's hand will reach
 through the trees and snatch me away from atop this rock.
 It feels strangely holy, having such an adamant belief that a supernatural
 being is going to abduct me.
 This is probably just my fascination with 
\emph on

messing with my head, though.

I look up at the piece of sky peeking through the trees, and smile.

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly, I remember the passage from 
\emph on
Slaughterhouse-Five
\emph default
.
 About Lot's wife.
 Close to me is the pile of sticks and fuel container I gathered a few weeks
 ago when I was considering lighting this forest on fire to condition myself
 for the flames of hell.
 It will serve as my imaginary audience.
 I clear my voice, then start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people
 and their homes had been.
 But she 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.
 So she was turned into a pillar of salt.
 So it goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kurt Vonnegut may well have written my memoir for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or maybe I should try making a salt sculpture and just printing a picture
 of it on every single page.
 That would really express me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I told myself I would only stay for a bit.
 I get up and take the usual path back to my house, put my shoes in their
 usual spot, and as usual splash some water on my face.
 As usual, as usual, as usual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I look into the mirror above the sink, and observe my face once more.
 So familiar it still is; how lucky I should consider myself that the years
 have been kind to me.
 If anything, the few wrinkles I do have give me a unique charm.
 If it were not for my pure-white hair, I could probably pass off as a woman
 in my forties.
 Ah, well.
 My only explanation is that the world has already weathered my soul enough
 that giving me the aches and sores of old age would simply be salt in the
 wound.
 Or maybe it's a curse, one that ensures I have both the health to live
 a long life and the indecisiveness to not be able to end it.
 How much I would give to know if after my passing I can finally be reunited
 with him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I sit down at my desk, and begin sorting papers.
 By this point, I am just trying my hardest to get out of starting writing
 today.
 After I sort my desk to the point where I cannot possibly convince myself
 that what I am doing is meaningful or worthwhile, I finally pull out my
 laptop and open the document I was working on.
 Computers and word processors sure made my work easier since I wrote my
 first book; many sections on my drafts for that one were scribbled on the
 backs of envelopes and stapled to my error-laden typewritten work.
 But maybe it was the feeling of having to jump through a few hoops to get
 my voice out there is what made me so inspired to write like a madwoman.
 Now, with me only neeing to hit a few buttons on this newfangled contraption,
 I feel absolutely no desire to write anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I find myself gazing at the piano in the corner.
 That poor thing hasn't had its beautiful sound coaxed out in decades.
 As much as I try to dabble in some small pieces, nothing I play can bring
 out the feelings he did.
 Express the simplicity and power of music like he did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stand up and sit down at the piano.
 This piano is truly wasted on an amateur like me, with its wonderfully
 light key action, its rich bass, and its sparkling trebles.
 A five-foot Cunningham, mahogany finish.
 Truly a beauty.
 It is truly a miracle that I managed to preserve it through all these years,
 with me being on the move all over the place and so many bouts of insanity
 leaving seemingly everything except dear Wellspring broken.
 It would have been so much easier to make my escape from the city to the
 countryside if I didn't have to find a piano mover to take my piano along,
 but I took the money out of my food budget, so here it is keeping me company.
\end_layout

Oh, dear Wellspring.

 I smile wryly at the absurdity coming from my mouth.
 I might as well play a bit since I am already here.
 I turn to browse the shelf beside the piano.
 Today, I'll try looking through that Clementi sonatina I tried last time;
 after all, he definitely would not approve of me playing big works with
 my technique!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I pull out the book and flip to the right page, I suddenly want to see
 it again.
 His face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I turn back to the shelf and take the picture frame out from underneath
 the pile of loose sheet music.
 And I look at him again.
 He looks so happy in that photo of us.
 Whether he was happy being there with me or because he had some tune stuck
 in his head, I will never know.
 I turn the frame to read again the newspaper clipping I taped on the back.
 A black and white picture of him playing at a concert in some big concert
 hall.
 The caption:

Suddenly, I felt my feet and ankles harden.
 I look down and see to my surprise and horror that my legs are turning
 into salt.
 I drop the picture and desperately try to stand up, but soon my legs are
 completely hardened.
 My midsection follows suit, and soon I cannot even bend my back.
 I decide it really is time to go.
 I cross my arms over my chest as they harden into salt, and as the conversion
 finally nears its end with my neck and head, I whisper a bit excitedly:

I close my eyes to prepare for the end.

I look down, and it turns out to again my surprise and horror that my legs,
 torso, and hands are all still flesh.
 My heart is still beating, my soul is still aching, my mind is still tormented.

Ah, the shattered glass of the picture frame is all over the ground under
 the piano.
 I stand up to go grab a dustpan to clean up.
 As I sweep the broken shards of glass, I lament:

The flashback (start of part 1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, I look back and think of everything as fate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changing to a new high school for my final year was a sudden decision that
 angered my parents.
 Why would someone whose parents set on a path into mathematics, whose appearanc
e in national mathematics competitions proved their skill and promise, have
 any need to enter an arts high school?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But by some sort of crazy twist of events, I managed to convince my parents
 to sign the transfer papers.
 Getting accepted into this private arts school was easy, even though I
 had no portfolio or outstanding achievements.
 I guess even a school of this kind needs some students with high marks
 to push up the school test score averages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would be pulling up the marks by a decent amount too, considering there
 were only ten students in the stream I chose.

Scriptwriting

The first day I walked into Principium Academy is a blur in my head now.
 An orientation that lasted way too long, a welcome ceremony with absolutely
 no substance, being left all by myself after planned activities when everyone
 grouped into the little cliques they entered this school with.
 It is all a distant memory for me now, and all so insignificant to this
 story that is unfolding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how could I forget the first time I entered the place where everything
 started?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The living quarters at this school were right beside the main campus.
 As soon as our orientation guide took us to see where we were staying,
 I immediately saw that the tuition we paid wasn't for nothing.
 A beautiful glistening lake with green grass all around it and clusters
 of housing units organized row by row overlooking it is what greeted us
 when we entered the gates.

The freshmen around me got very excited, as I recall.
 I was the only transfer student in this group, and somehow it felt strange
 to join in with them.
 I stayed silent, and did not betray just how amazed I was at the aesthetics
 of where I was spending this year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guide talked to us about the history of the building and about the excellent
 placement of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, but everyone was wondering the same question: 
\emph on
When can we finally go in?
\emph default
 When the guide finally let us take our leave, all of the freshman rushed
 into their rooms without even going back to the student center where our
 baggage locked.
 I remember walking back to the main campus all alone, which I would do
 every morning for the rest of the year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I finally managed to enter my unit with a suitcase in each hand, the
 very first thing I noticed was a piano in the common room.
 Thinking back, I don't know why I didn't notice the excellent view of the
 lake from the windows, or the spacious size of the bedrooms, or the excellent
 wooden furnishings in the kitchen and eating area.
 The very first thing I thought when I entered the place where I became
 myself was, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why is this damn piano here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 How strange it all was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I didn't think much of it, and went into my assigned bedroom to unpack.
 I probably did as I would do now, unceremoniously dumping out all my clothing
 onto the floor then separating it into piles that roughly constitute a
 full outfit.
 Good thing I only have black, white, or red shirts as well as black skirts
 and pants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Six possible outfits in all," I commented.
 Probably.
 I might have also tried to calculate the probability of getting one of
 those outfits if I randomly dressed from one of those piles, but more likely
 I looked into my other suitcase and pulled out a neatly wrapped present
 for my roommate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would be my first time having a roommate.
 I wanted everything to go perfectly, so I spent hours trying to think of
 the perfect gift.
 In the end, I decided on a care package with pens, a small corkboard, pins,
 and (this one I was proud of) a pack of stationery with words of wisdom
 carefully chosen and written by me onto every sheet.
 There was enough for my roommate to put up a new one every day for the
 rest of the school year.
 I really hope she likes it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Here is a present for you, I am happy to make your acquaintance!" I practiced
 my greeting.
 "No, no, too formal...
 Hey, this is for you, hope we get along! Better..."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I needed to get this right.
 I would be living with this person for the rest of the year, after all;
 she and I had better get along, or I would lose the chance to finally make
 a close friend.
 But at that moment, I was incredibly tired from the tour.
 I made my bed with the sheets, blanket and bedding I brought, and took
 a short nap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although that short nap was awfully long.
 When I woke up, my room was totally dark.
 I slept all the way from early afternoon to after sunset.
 My roommate must have already unpacked by this point, and probably was
 wondering what I was doing.
 I scramble to turn on the lights and check in my small mirror if I looked
 halfway presentable, then stumbled out of my room with the present in hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lights were off in the unit.
 The other bedroom's door was slightly ajar.
 I peeked inside, then opened the room completely to confirm what I saw:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The room was completely empty except for the sheetless single bed and writing
 desk.
 Somehow, even after so many hours, my roommate still hadn't unpacked or
 even taken her baggage from the student center.
 A quick look around the unit confirmed that she wasn't in the unit at all.

Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At a well-known arts high school, Michelle does not know anyone when she
 first transfers in, because she chose to come to this school to escape
 her parents' set path for her to study mathematics.
 She does not have any roommates in the two-person complex, much to her
 relief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She does not get the chance to meet anyone else in the school because of
 her shyness and because of her newest writing project, a play that she
 wants produced within her high school by their esteemed drama troupe.
 Because some girls from the drama troupe take a liking to Michelle, they
 pledge their support for her goal to become the playwright of the school
 production and potentially make it big.
 However, Michelle is skeptical of whether or not investing so much time
 in writing is worthwhile.
 She tries convinving herself that writing is a worthless talent and that
 she should just focus on her studies, go to university, then become a schooltea
cher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the popularity of the art school, every dorm room is fully occupied
 except for that of Michelle.
 But an up-and-coming pianist very famous in his own country comes to the
 art school to expand his horizons, and he is assigned to Michelle's dorm.
 Michelle is distressed as she does not feel comfortable living with a male
 she does not know, but her housing don assures her that the boy is not
 dangerous or threatening and swears her to silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It becomes apparent, through Michelle's interactions with the new transfer
 student, that the boy, registered in the school as “Amadeus” (Michelle
 eventually calls him “Ami”), is a genius.
 From the moment Ami enters the dorm, there was always some sort of otherworldly
 sound playing while Michelle is at home, whether it be one of Ami's enigmatic
 vinyls or his own strangely raw and shimmering playing.
 He always refers to music in “colors”, a concept that always amused Michelle.
 He was trained by very famous teachers, and his playing of French Impressionist
 compositions (such as those of Debussy) quickly capture the attention of
 the school administration and the school's drama troupe.
 The drama troupe decides unanimously that Ami will compose and play the
 music for the school play, regardless of who ends up being the scriptwriter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This development, combined with Michelle's frustration that Ami seemingly
 doesn't care about anything despite his talent, causes Michelle to blow
 up at Ami over a trivial incident and decry him for being directionless.
 Ami calmly asks Michelle what color she wants to be, and Michelle is very
 taken back at the question.
 She apologizes to Ami for her outburst, and said that she was basically
 projecting herself onto other people to feel better after her inadequacy.
 She says that she herself does not have any direction in life, and so decides
 that she is “opalescent”, a shimmer of all the colors.
 Ami says that that is where he and Michelle are different; while Michelle
 is still trying to grow up and discover herself, Ami already has decided
 on his color: white, the focused universal shade that paradoxically both
 is a combination of every color and lacks any color at all.
 He says this is why he will never be happy, because there are so many things
 that he has in his life but which impede him in becoming what he wants
 to be.
 He says he will not accept Michelle's response, but will wait until she
 has one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michelle is touched by what Ami says and has a new-found respect for him.
 It inspires her to write the plan for a new play she had in mind, very
 loosely based on her encounters with Ami.
 She shows it to the drama troupe and they adore it.
 They manage to secure her position as the scriptwriter for the school play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While working on the play with input from Ami, Michelle learns about his
 past.
 He suffered a horrible hand injury when he was younger at the hands of
 an abusive piano teacher, and even though he has perfect technique right
 now, exerting himself in even the slightest strained way results in immense
 pain.
 The reason why he became so fascinated with Debussy is because his particular
 view on technique for playing his piece required very little strain in
 the wrist and forearms, which makes it much easier for Ami due to his injury.
 Michelle sometimes finds Ami trying to play the works of Bach and the late
 Beethoven sonatas, but because of his inability to strain his hands in
 any way it often causes him crippling pain and affects the amount he can
 practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the middle of her work on the play, Michelle finds out that Ami will
 be leaving the school the day after the final show.
 Michelle reads her synopsis for the ending of her play out loud while she
 thinks she is alone.
 It turns out that the ending of her play (remember: based off of her and
 Ami) ends with the male lead leaving and never coming back.
 Ami is actually listening to Michelle reading it, and when Michelle finishes
 Ami knocks on the door, surprising and upsetting Michelle.
 Ami simply says that he has the music for the play ready and leaves.
 Later, Michelle listens to Ami's practice and hears a new tune that puts
 her to tears.
 She realizes that she has started to depend on Ami as her source of inspiration
, and she becomes scared of what the future will hold when Ami leaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michelle eventually finds out Ami is leaving because he got a commission
 for his own performance at a very famous concert hall.
 Michelle realizes that the concert hall got a hold of Ami because she herself
 had sent a fully-written script to an associated theater company with a
 soundtrack by Ami, and that the people at the theater completely disregarded
 her work and instead passed the soundtrack off to the event organizers
 at the concert hall.
 Michelle, enraged at the irreparable and irreconcilable rift between the
 genius and the ordinary, violently attacks Ami, who sustains a hand injury.
 Horrified at what she had done, Michelle goes back to her room and screams
 in her pillow until she passes out from fatigue.
 She and Ami do not talk for weeks, and Michelle continues work on her play
 while Ami slowly regains the strength in his injured hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rehearsals for the play are going smoothly, and of course Ami's moving compositi
ons along with his insightful playing quickly becomes the glue that makes
 the whole work stick together to form a masterpiece.
 Michelle starts to worry more and more about the ending of the play which
 she is forced to watch every day.
 She begins to dread the day of the premiere, as it essentially will become
 the farewell conversation between Michelle and Ami as both are still uncomforta
ble with talking to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The day before the first show, Michelle and Ami are both silent at the dinner
 table, as always.
 However, when Michelle is in her room, she realizes that Ami has been pushing
 his injured hand to unbearable limits.
 Ami, who was calm during all of Michelle's angry outbursts and brushed
 it off when Michelle hurt his hand, was crying at the piano because he
 wasn't able to play a single note.
 Michelle is deeply moved by what Ami is doing for her.
 In a sudden emotional and impulsive moment, she hastily sends an email.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the day of the premiere, the entire audience is captivated by the play
 and the amazing pianist who is playing the music for it.
 However, when it comes to the ending, the male protagonist stops right
 before he leaves, and turns around to say that he will always yearn to
 be with what he loves.
 The characters, who in the original version walk off both sides of the
 stage, instead share an embrace and make a pinky promise.
 Ami, watching from his place in the music pit, appears clearly surprised,
 but keeps on playing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next day, Michelle wakes up early to talk to Ami before he leaves and
 finally make amends for her lash-out.
 She wakes up only to see that Ami's room is completely empty.
 She calls Ami, who is on the train to the airport.
 Ami simply says that Michelle has already put into his mouth everything
 that he has wanted to say, and that the promise that Michelle's characters
 made will hold.
 Michelle tells Ami that she finally has a response to his question about
 which color she wants to be: she decides that for the rest of her life,
 she will strive to be as blue as the ocean that separates them and the
 same heavens they see above them.
 Ami accepts Michelle's response and tells her to look in the piano that
 is still in the dorm; inside, Michelle finds a CD and listens to it.
 It is a transposition of the final piece from the play into a major key.
 Michelle is elated, but Ami hangs up before she can say thank you.
 After this point, Ami's number goes out of service.

Many years later, Michelle, who managed to make a living writing scripts
 for small productions in the local theater, reads in the paper that a very
 accomplished pianist has killed himself after he was told by doctors that
 his carpal tunnel syndrome will prevent him from ever playing piano like
 before.
 It is a name she does not recognize, but as soon as she sees the picture
 she knows that it was Ami.
 Some of the actors from the high school drama troupe, now professional
 theater actors, give Michelle their condolences because they think that
 Ami ended up breaking the promise to Michelle.
 Michelle laughs and shakes her head, saying that in the end Ami did keep
 his promise of always yearning to be what he loves; he is in death as he
 was in life, never having to live a day without the piano and the music
 that plays in his soul.

Talks about God
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michelle grew up in a Catholic family, but slowly felt more and more distanced
 from God.
 Through her interactions with Ami, she starts wondering about fate/destiny
 and the concept of free will.
 When she asks Ami what he thinks about God, he said he always committed
 himself to a life connected to music and those he cares about (referring
 to his family and Michelle) because if there is a God, it would satisfy
 him, and if there isn't, they only have each other.
 Michelle is greatly moved by this, and regains her faith in the power of
 humanity.
