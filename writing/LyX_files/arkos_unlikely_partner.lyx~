It's still somewhat hard to not fall asleep while putting my armor on.
 The circlet on my head feels like it's going to squeeze my brains out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Focus, focus.
 
\emph default
How many times have I had days like this again? If I really wanted to know,
 I could count the trophies in my room at home, but really, no matter what
 the number, I am already used to this kind of thing.
 I just need to get into it when everything starts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I really wish I slept better yesterday, though.
 We already went to bed pretty late, then there were three girls close to
 me chatting about a book or something, so it was hard to sleep.
 It didn't help that the Schnee heiress joined in to (loudly) tell them
 they were keeping people awake.
 Classic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there was also the excitement of being at a new school.
 Back home, it was getting really tiring having the same people fawn over
 me all the time.
 Maybe here, at least 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 people will treat me like a normal person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, there was that awkward guy making a scene yesterday.
 He seems pretty nice.
 I wonder if I'll see him today.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, to get Milo and Akouo from the locker room.
 As I strut down the halls, I immediately regret having worn my armor already.
 People are already pointing at me and uttering my name.

\begin_layout Standard
I really should have gotten dressed in the closest bathroom to the locker
 room.
 Oh well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I finally get to the right row of lockers, the Schnee girl is already
 there.
 I can see
\emph on
 Weiss Schnee
\emph default
 printed on the tag on her locker.
 Guess that's her name.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course she notices me.
 She beams a smile that's a bit too wide.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hey, Pyrrha! Nice to meet you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi, Weiss,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I respond politely.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am happy to make your acquaintance.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I go to open my locker.
 But as I do, I hear a familiar voice...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ridiculous! There's no way I put my gear in locker 636 yesterday...
 I would have remembered having to count that high!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It must be him.
 Sure enough, a little glance tells me that it's the guy from yesterday
 walking down the rows of lockers.
 His aimless wandering makes me want to go help him, but then Weiss turns
 around and starts speaking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, Pyrrha, have you given any thought to whose team you would like to be
 on?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Weiss sounds a bit too expectant.
 Years of having people ask me to join their group for anything have made
 me good at picking up these cues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not quite sure.
 I was planning on letting the chips fall where they may.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Please, don't push on.
 Please please please.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I was thinking maybe we could be on a team together.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And there we go.
 She asks the question I have heard way too many times.
 I keep my composure and stop myself from scoffing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, that sounds grand!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weiss immediately starts smiling incredibly stupidly.
 I bet she's only being nice to ride off of my fame.
 How charming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I look around and see that the guy from yesterday is walking over.
 
\emph on
Is he going to hit on me?
\emph default
 It wouldn't be unusual, in any case.
 Plus, he's kinda cute, I guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But that's when I notice he's fixated on Weiss.
 He comes in between us and leans against the lockers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jaune Arc.
 Nice to meet you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weiss immediately rolls her eyes and crosses her arms.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nice to meet you, Jaune!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I try to get his attention, but he just keeps on talking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, Weiss, couldn't help but overhear your fondness of me the other day.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weiss groans.
 And Jaune just keeps going.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, I've been hearing rumors about teams~ I was thinking you and me would
 make a good one.
 Whattaya say?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Actually,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I say, finally catching his attention, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think the teams are comprised of four students each, so...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He finally comes over to talk to me.
 
\emph on
Cute, just like I thought.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, hot stuff, play your cards right and maybe you could join up with
 the winning team.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of course, Weiss jumps back into the conversation.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jaune, is it? Do you have any idea who you're talking to?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not in the slightest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jaune says while leaning in closer.
 I would think he's acting kind of creepy, if it wasn't so obvious that
 he's not used to this kind of thing.
 I almost feel inspired at how determined he is, even though he's getting
 shot down over and over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Weiss and Jaune talk about my achievements at Sanctum Academy and my
 cereal endorsement, I muse to myself.
 
\emph on
He really knows nothing about me.
 I'm just a normal person to him.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, after hearing all of this, do you really think you're in a position
 to ask 
\emph on
her 
\emph default
to be on your team?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Weiss says it in the classic stuck-up Schnee manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it looks like Weiss managed to break Jaune's spirits.
 He noticeably slumps a little.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess not.
 Sorry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
No, no, please be on my team! Finally, someone who won't leave me on this
 pedestal! Replace the Schnee girl, ah~
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Actually, Jaune, I think you'd make a 
\emph on
great
\emph default
 leader!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He brightens up again.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, stop it!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He tries saying in a coy way.
 Doesn't work for him.
 But it's kinda cute, in a dorky way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we really need to get to the meeting spot now.
 If only I could talk to this Jaune guy forever; that would sure beat all
 these people who treat me like I'm an alien.

On Beacon Cliff, I look into the Emerald Forest and note its geography.
 Apparently, we're being projected into the forest on these special launch
 pads.
 
\emph on
Land, find partner, get relic.

\emph default
 Easy plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I try to focus my mind when the person next to me launches.
 I'm next.
 As I take off into the air, I can still hear Jaune nervously asking a million
 questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I fly through the sky and into the forest, I realize something.
 
\emph on
Will Jaune be okay? He seemed a bit unsure during Ozpin's explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, wow, I'm thinking about him now.
 After having so many guys either want to be with me just for my fame or
 guys completely avoid me because I am 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out of their league
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there is finally a guy who just treats me like a normal girl.
 And it's kind of exciting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I land on a tree branch and immediately use Milo in rifle mode to scope
 the skies for Jaune.
 I find him flailing while falling aimlessly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I transform Milo into javelin mode, and line up my shot.
 
\emph on
Make a straight line with your javelin and free arm, aim with the thumb.

\emph default
 I throw Milo and hear a satisfying 
\emph on
thunk

a few seconds later.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I hear in Jaune's sheepish voice
\emph on
.

\emph default
 Successfully pinned him to a tree.
 Who knew my javelin training would come in handy like this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I run through the woods in the direction of Milo.
 I can feel where it is from here.
 Southwest.
 I can feel like magnetic pull to me get stronger and stronger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I see him now.
 He seems to be calling out for help.
 I see a glimpse of Weiss dragging that girl in red I saw last night.
 
\emph on
Ah, so she saw Red, ran off, bumped into Jaune, and decided Red over Jaune.
 Perfect for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jaune?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I call up to him, and he looks down.
 I blush a little.
 I hope he can't see it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you...
 have any spots left on your team?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I quip lightly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looks embarrassed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Very funny.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But as he says it, I can see him smiling ever so slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I catch myself smiling more than I have in ages.
 
\emph on
At last, someone who doesn't assume we're from totally different worlds.
 Someone who doesn't treat me differently before they even know me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I think I can finally make a good friend.
