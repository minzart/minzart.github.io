\begin_layout Standard
At a well-known arts high school, Michelle does not know anyone when she
 first transfers in because she entered the school from overseas.
 She does not have any roommates in the two-person complex, much to her
 relief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She does not get the chance to meet anyone else in the school because of
 her shyness and because of her newest writing project, a play that she
 wants produced within her high school by their esteemed drama troupe.
 Because some girls from the drama troupe take a liking to Michelle, they
 pledge their support for her goal to become the playwright of the school
 production and potentially make it big.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the popularity of the art school, every dorm room is fully occupied
 except for that of Michelle.
 But an up-and-coming pianist very famous in his own country comes to the
 art school to expand his horizons, and he is assigned to Michelle's dorm.
 Michelle is distressed as she does not feel comfortable living with a male
 she does not know, but the school administration assures her that the boy
 is not of danger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It becomes apparent, through Michelle's interactions with the new transfer
 student, that the boy, registered in the school as “Amadeus” (Michelle
 eventually calls him “Ami”), is a genius.
 From the moment Ami enters the dorm, there was always some sort of otherworldly
 sound playing while Michelle is at home, whether it be one of Ami's enigmatic
 CD tracks or his own strangely raw and shimmering playing.
 He always refers to music in “colors”, a concept that always amused Michelle.
 He was trained by very famous teachers, and his playing of French Impressionist
 compositions (such as those of Debussy) quickly capture the attention of
 the school administration and the school's drama troupe.
 The drama troupe decides unanimously that Ami will compose and play the
 music for the school play, regardless of who ends up being the scriptwriter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This development, combined with Michelle's frustration that Ami seemingly
 doesn't care about anything despite his talent, causes Michelle to blow
 up at Ami over a trivial incident and decry him for being directionless.
 Ami calmly asks Michelle what color she wants to be, and Michelle is very
 taken back at the question.
 She apologizes to Ami for her outburst, and said that she was basically
 projecting herself onto other people to feel better after her inadequacy.
 She says that she herself does not have any direction in life, and so decides
 that she is “opalescent”, a shimmer of all the colors.
 Ami says that that is where he and Michelle are different; while Michelle
 is still trying to grow up and discover herself, Ami already has decided
 on his color: white, the focused universal shade that paradoxically both
 is a combination of every color and lacks any color at all.
 He says this is why he will never be happy, because there are so many things
 that he has in his life but which impede him in becoming what he wants
 to be.
 He says he will not accept Michelle's response, but will wait until she
 has one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michelle is touched by what Ami says and has a new-found respect for him.
 It inspires her to write the plan for a new play she had in mind, very
 loosely based on her encounters with Ami.
 She shows it to the drama troupe and they adore it.
 They manage to secure her position as the scriptwriter for the school play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the middle of her work on the play, Michelle finds out that Ami will
 be leaving the school the day after the final show.
 Michelle reads her synopsis for the ending of her play out loud while she
 thinks she is alone.
 It turns out that the ending of her play (remember: based off of her and
 Ami) ends with the male lead leaving and never coming back.
 Ami is actually listening to Michelle reading it, and when Michelle finishes
 Ami knocks on the door, surprising and upsetting Michelle.
 Ami simply says that he has the music for the play ready and leaves.
 Later, Michelle listens to Ami's practice and hears a new tune that puts
 her to tears.
 She realizes that she has started to depend on Ami as her source of inspiration
, and she becomes scared of what the future will hold when Ami leaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michelle eventually finds out Ami is leaving because he got a commission
 for his own performance at a very famous concert hall.
 Michelle realizes that the concert hall got a hold of Ami because she herself
 had sent a fully-written script to an associated theater company with a
 soundtrack by Ami, and that the people at the theater completely disregarded
 her work and instead passed the soundtrack off to the event organizers
 at the concert hall.
 Michelle, enraged at the irreparable and irreconcilable rift between the
 genius and the ordinary, violently attacks Ami, who sustains a hand injury.
 Horrified at what she had done, Michelle goes back to her room and screams
 in her pillow until she passes out from fatigue.
 She and Ami do not talk for weeks, and Michelle continues work on her play
 while Ami slowly regains the strength in his injured hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rehearsals for the play are going smoothly, and of course Ami's moving compositi
ons along with his insightful playing quickly becomes the glue that makes
 the whole work stick together to form a masterpiece.
 Michelle starts to worry more and more about the ending of the play which
 she is forced to watch every day.
 She begins to dread the day of the premiere, as it essentially will become
 the farewell conversation between Michelle and Ami as both are still uncomforta
ble with talking to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The day before the first show, Michelle and Ami are both silent at the dinner
 table, as always.
 However, when Michelle is in her room, she realizes that Ami has been pushing
 his injured hand to unbearable limits.
 Ami, who was calm during all of Michelle's angry outbursts and brushed
 it off when Michelle hurt his hand, was crying at the piano because he
 wasn't able to play a single note.
 Michelle is deeply moved by what Ami is doing for her.
 In a sudden emotional and impulsive moment, she hastily sends an email.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the day of the premiere, the entire audience is captivated by the play
 and the amazing pianist who is playing the music for it.
 However, when it comes to the ending, the male protagonist stops right
 before he leaves, and turns around to say that he will always yearn to
 be with what he loves.
 The characters, who in the original version walk off both sides of the
 stage, instead share an embrace and make a pinky promise.
 Ami, watching from his place in the music pit, appears clearly surprised,
 but keeps on playing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next day, Michelle wakes up early to talk to Ami before he leaves and
 finally make amends for her lash-out.
 She wakes up only to see that Ami's room is completely empty.
 She calls Ami, who is on the train to the airport.
 Ami simply says that Michelle has already put into his mouth everything
 that he has wanted to say, and that the promise that Michelle's characters
 made will hold.
 Michelle tells Ami that she finally has a response to his question about
 which color she wants to be: she decides that for the rest of her life,
 she will strive to be as blue as the ocean that separates them and the
 same heavens they see above them.
 Ami accepts Michelle's response and tells her to look in the piano that
 is still in the dorm; inside, Michelle finds a CD and listens to it.
 It is a transposition of the final piece from the play into a major key.
 Michelle is elated, but Ami hangs up before she can say thank you.
 After this point, Ami's number goes out of service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many years later, Michelle, who managed to make a living writing scripts
 for small productions in the local theater, reads in the paper that a very
 accomplished pianist has killed himself after he was told by doctors that
 his carpal tunnel syndrome will prevent him from ever playing piano like
 before.
 It is a name she does not recognize, but as soon as she sees the picture
 she knows that it was Ami.
 Some of the actors from the high school drama troupe, now professional
 theater actors, give Michelle their condolences because they think that
 Ami ended up breaking the promise to Michelle.
 Michelle laughs and shakes her head, saying that in the end Ami did keep
 his promise of always yearning to be what he loves; he is in death as he
 was in life, never having to live a day without the piano and the music
 that plays in his soul.
