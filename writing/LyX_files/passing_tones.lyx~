This was written in an English class, then changed around for a competition.

My hands tremble as I hit “Send”.
 My eyes dart to the Subject line: "Entry - Short Story Contest".
 My unease linger long after the message sends.

, my teacher suggested.
 And so, my thoughts turned to one person: friend, advisor, idol\SpecialChar \ldots{}

The one I love.

\begin_layout Standard
She is a golden fruit; any flaw she had was simply a small bruise that made
 her even sweeter.
 Whenever she played the piano for me, I listened with not only my ears
 but also my heart.
 She is Brahms’ Clara Wieck, Chopin’s George Sand, Liszt’s Marie d'Agoult:
 the target of a hopeless admirer looking upon a treasure one branch too
 far away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those calm twilight hours full of music and joy will stay in my heart forever.
 Shared cries, joined laughter, and high hopes filled the room when sunlight
 could not.
 If only we could never be farther apart than two musicians performing a
 duet!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When she told me she was moving away, I was crushed.
 She had visions of seeing new places and escaping this plain, fameless
 city; I had a simple hope of going to our local university.
 Conflicting ambitions threatened the existence of our friendship—and of
 my ardent affection.
 I feared the day when we would each fade from the other's memories.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I take my teacher's suggestion and weep the entire night as I write my entry
 for the short story contest.
 I rewrite and rewrite, but the final line stays the same: "And with tears
 flowing, I took in her words: 'I am leaving soon.'" 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alone in the dark room, I slump against the piano.
 Her sprint out the door re-plays in my head over and over.
 My fist clenches around the bouquet of roses.
 The rejected flowers seem to cry with me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I never see her again.
 Never get to say goodbye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few days after submission, I find out I won the contest—conditionally.
 “Rewrite the ending,” the editor commented.
 “Make it resonate like the rest of the story!” When I finally rewrite the
 only sentence I desperately want to fix, my eyes well up as I re-read:
 "And with tears flowing, I took in her words: 'I will stay with you forever.
 No matter what happens, just remember that I love you.'"
